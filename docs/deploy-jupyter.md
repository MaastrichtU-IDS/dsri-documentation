title: Start Jupyter Notebooks
---

Feel free to propose new deployments using [pull requests](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/dsri-documentation/pulls) or request new ones by creating a [new issues](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/dsri-documentation/issues).

## Start JupyterHub

Use the **JupyterHub with GitHub authentication (Dynamic)** template to start a JupyterHub service, users will be able to login with their GitHub account, and start a notebook choosing from various images.

This solution enable you to use the DSRI to run Jupyter notebooks for multiple users without the need for a DSRI account, or knowledge of OpenShift. All they need is a GitHub account and access to the UM network (via the UM VPN).

Persistent volumes are automatically created for each instance started in JupyterHub to insure persistence of the data even if the instances or JupyterHub are stopped.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The users will be able to install new `pip` packages in their JupyterLab instance, but they will not have `sudo` privileges (so they cannot install `apt` or `yum` packages)

A custom image can be built and provided when deploying JupyterHub, see this repository as example to build a JupyterLab Docker image supported by OpenShift: https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/jupyterlab-on-openshift

## Start JupyterLab with root user

You will need to have enabled root containers (aka. anyuid) in your project to start a container as root user, [contact us üì¨](mailto:dsri-support-l@maastrichtuniversity.nl) to do so.

You can deploy it using the **JupyterLab with root user** solutions in the [Catalog web UI](https://app.dsri.unimaas.nl:8443/console/catalog):

<img src="/dsri-documentation/img/screenshot-deploy-jupyter.png" alt="Deploy Jupyter" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;" />

2 deployments are available:

ü¶ã **Ephemeral**: volumes bind to the pod, data will be lost when the pod is deleted.

üóÑÔ∏è **Persistent**: use a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) for a persistent storage of the data.

The following parameters can be provided:

1. Provide a unique **Application name**
2. The **Password** is safely stored in a Secret.
3. You can provide a **Git repository URL** with files to be downloaded and requirements to be installed at the start of the application. 
4. **Storage name** (only for persistent): the storage Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
5. **Storage folder** (only for persistent): path to the Notebook folder in the Persistent Volume Claim storage

This deployment require to have  root user enabled on your project. Contact the [DSRI support team](mailto:dsri-support-l@maastrichtuniversity.nl) to request root access if you don't have them.

Pip requirements, apt packages and Jupyterlab extensions are installed from `requirements.txt`, `packages.txt` and `extensions.txt` requirement files.

## Start JupyterLab with restricted user

[Source-to-Image (S2I)](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/creating_images/s2i.html) builds allow to deploy Jupyter Notebooks as non-root user, which is a practice recommended  by OpenShift but prevents you to install packages requiring the root user after the pod has been built. 

> **You will not be root user**‚ö†Ô∏è you will be able to install new `pip` packages, but you will not have `sudo` privileges (so no installation of `apt` or `yum` packages)

Two deployments are available for the **JupyterLab with restricted user** template:

ü¶ã **Ephemeral**: volumes bind to the pod, data will be lost when the pod is deleted.

‚ö° **Dynamic**:  automatically create a persistent storage for the notebook data

The following parameters can to be provided:

1. Provide a unique **Application name**
2. The **Password** is safely stored in a secret.
3. Choose the **Notebook interface**:
   * `classic`: Jupyter notebook web UI.
   * `lab`: Jupyterlab web UI.
4. Provide the base **S2I Builder image** used by S2I to build your image with the provided requirements installed:
   * `s2i-minimal-notebook:3.6` : minimal jupyter notebook
   * `s2i-scipy-notebook:3.6` : notebook with popular scientific libraries pre-installed
   * `s2i-tensorflow-notebook:3.6` : notebook with tensorflow libraries for machine learning.
5. (only for ephemeral) URL to the Git repository with the requirements and the code to clone in the notebook. The repository typically have a `requirements.txt` file at the root to install the libraries that will be used. See as examples:
   * https://github.com/vemonet/PythonDataScienceHandbook
   * https://github.com/marcelbrouwers/sample-notebooks
   * https://github.com/vemonet/TensorFlow-Examples

By default the working directory is `/opt/app-root/src`

> Built from [jupyter-on-openshift](https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift/jupyter-notebooks).

> See [MaastrichtU-IDS/jupyterlab-on-openshift](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/jupyterlab-on-openshift) as example to build custom JupyterLab images optimized for OpenShift 

## Anaconda and Tensorflow with Jupyter

Another option to run Jupyter notebooks with Anaconda and Tensorflow installed.

This deployment needs to be done through the UI > `Deploy Image`

Use [jupyter/tensorflow-notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/tensorflow-notebook) official Docker image.

* Image name:

  ```shell
  jupyter/tensorflow-notebook
  ```
  
* Environment variables:

  * `JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB` : `yes` (optional)

* Mount storage:

  * Go to the deployments page > Click **Actions** > Select **Add Storage**
  * Mount the storage in `/home/jovyan`.


> Go to the `pod logs` to get the `login token`.
