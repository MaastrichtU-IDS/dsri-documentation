title: Quickstart with templates

The easiest to get started with the DSRI is to use the predefined templates to deploy an application.

Multiple templates are available for Data Science:

* VisualStudio Code server
* JupyterHub
* JupyterLab with restricted or root user
* RStudio with Shiny server
* Tensorflow or PyTorch on GPU
* Apache Spark cluster

To see all templates defined to start Data Science applications on the DSRI, go your project catalog in the OpenShift web UI:
* **Add to Project** > **Browse Catalog**
* Click on **Filter** to choose the **Institute of Data Science, UM** publisher
