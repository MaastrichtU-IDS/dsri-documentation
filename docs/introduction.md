The Data Science Research Infrastructure is an [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) cluster based on the [MapR](https://mapr.com/) Distributed FileSystem, using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) containers orchestration.

The DSRI provides a graphical user interface to easily run and manage services ([OKD](https://www.okd.io/)). Multiple workflow orchestration tools can be deployed, such as [Argo workflows](/dsri-documentation/docs/argo-install), [Nextflow](/dsri-documentation/docs/nextflow) or [CWL Calrissian](/dsri-documentation/docs/cwl-calrissian).

See the [DSRI workshop presentation](/dsri-documentation/resource/dsri_openshift_workshop.pdf) or the [DSRI story presentation](/dsri-documentation/resource/dsri_story_201907.pdf) for more details.
