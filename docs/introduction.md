The Data Science Research Infrastructure is an [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) cluster based on the [MapR](https://mapr.com/) Distributed File System, using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) containers orchestration.

The DSRI provides a graphical user interface to easily run and manage services ([OKD](https://www.okd.io/), the Open Source version of [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/)). 

## What can be done on the DSRI?

Any service that: 

* runs in a Docker container üê≥ (Any code can be easily executed in a Docker container (apart from some proprietary software)
* does not need to be accessed from outside the UM network (or the UM VPN) üîí

In more details:

**What can be done easily on the DSRI ‚úîÔ∏è**

* [Start any Docker image](https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/dsri-documentation/docs/deploy-from-docker) from the web UI
* [Start a simple Jupyter Notebook or RStudio](https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/dsri-documentation/docs/deploy-jupyter) through the web UI
* Deploy TensorFlow or PyTorch [on GPUs](https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/dsri-documentation/docs/deploy-on-gpu) (8 Nvidia DGX-1 GPU cores are available)
* Start a [Apache Spark cluster](/dsri-documentation/docs/deploy-spark) with multiples nodes, and a Jupyter Notebook from the web UI
* [Request a persistent storage üì¨](mailto:dsri-support-l@maastrichtuniversity.nl) to store data for your computational project (from GB to a few TB).

**What can be done with extra configuration ‚å®Ô∏è**

* Use [workflow orchestration tools](/dsri-documentation/docs/workflows-introduction), such as [Argo workflows](/dsri-documentation/docs/workflows-argo), [Nextflow](/dsri-documentation/docs/workflows-nextflow) or [CWL Calrissian](/dsri-documentation/docs/cwl-calrissian).
* Run [OpenMPI](https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/dsri-documentation/docs/deploy-services#openmpi) jobs

**What cannot be done ‚ùå**

* You cannot deploy services on the public Internet, the DSRI and services deployed on the **DSRI can only be accessed when on the UM network or using the UM VPN**.
* Be careful to respect the host websites limitations when running applications to scrap data from the web, e.g. when retrieving publications from a scientific publisher.

[Contact us üì¨](mailto:dsri-support-l@maastrichtuniversity.nl) to request an account, and run your services on the DSRI from the UM network.

## The DSRI specifications

### Software

* **[OKD 3.11](https://www.okd.io/)** (Open Source version of [RedHat OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/)) to run services and jobs.
  * Working on upgrading to [OKD 4.5](https://github.com/openshift/okd/releases)
* **[HP MapR](https://mapr.com/)** for distributed storage.
  * [RedHat Ceph storage](https://www.redhat.com/fr/technologies/storage/ceph) also considered

### Hardware

* 15 CPU nodes

|                | RAM (GB) | CPU (cores) | Storage (TB) |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Node capacity  | 512 GB   | 64 cores    | 120 TB       |
| Total capacity | 7 680 GB | 960 cores   | 1800 TB      |

* 1 GPU node
