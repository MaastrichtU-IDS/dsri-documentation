## From the UM network

You need to be connected to the UM network to access the DSRI:

* Use [Maastricht University VPN](https://vpn.maastrichtuniversity.nl/)

## Access the web UI

Access the DSRI web UI at **[https://app.dsri.unimaas.nl:8443](https://app.dsri.unimaas.nl:8443)**

The DSRI web UI gives an overview of your project and the applications currently running. You can start new applications using templates from the `Institute of Data Science, UM` provider or Docker images.

> We recommend you to install the `oc` command line tool to perform additional operations on your applications, such as loading large amount of data using `oc cp`, or deploying an application from a local Dockerfile.
