It is recommend to use the `oc` tool to delete an application, as it will allow to properly delete all objects related to the application deployment.

Connect to your project

```shell
oc project my-project
```

## Stop an application

When you are not using your application anymore you can stop the pod. If you are using a Dynamic or Persistent storage you can restart the pod and continue working with all your data in the same state as you left it.

> ⚠️ Please think of stopping applications you are not using to avoid consuming unnecessary resources.

On the **Overview** page click on the down arrow ⬇️ next to the number of pods deployed.

<img src="/dsri-documentation/img/screenshot_scaledown_pod.png" alt="Scale down pod" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;" />

You can then restart the pod by clicking the up arrow ⬆️

## Delete deployed application

Use a selector to easily delete all objects generated by an application deployment. The selector can easily be found in the template configuration:

<img src="/dsri-documentation/img/screenshot-get-deployment-label.png" alt="Get deployment label" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;" />

All object created by the template will be tagged with the labels defined at this step.

In this example, with Apache Spark, the following selector can be used to get all objects related to the `spark` deloyment:

```shell
oc get all --selector app=jupyterhub
```

### Delete an application deployment

Delete most objects related to an application use the `all` keyword, and a label selector with your application id.

```shell
oc delete all --selector app=my-application
```

> For some templates it might not be enough, see below to delete all deployed object.

### Delete all deployed objects

The best way to make sure all objects related to your application have been deleted is to use the command line:

```shell
oc delete all,secret,configmaps,serviceaccount,rolebinding --selector app=my-application
```

> Delete storage if necessary from the OpenShift web UI.

### Force deletion

If the objects are not deleting properly you can force their deletion:

```shell
oc delete all --force --grace-period=0 --selector app=my-deployment
```

### Delete persistent storage

To delete a persistent storage dynamically created:

```bash
oc delete pvc/storage-name
```

---

## Delete pod

Get the ID of the specific pod you want to delete:

```shell
oc get pod
```

Use the pod ID retrieved to delete the pod:

```shell
oc delete pod <pod_id>
```

Force deletion:

```shell
oc delete pod --force --grace-period=0 <pod_id>
```

## Fix stuck deletions

### Stuck provisioned service

If a provisioned service is stuck on `Marked for deletion` you might need to set finalizers to null in the YAML.

This can be done using the OpenShift web UI:

* Go to the **Provisionned Service** in the OpenShift UI overview

* Click on **Edit YAML**

* Remove the **finalizers**:

  ```yaml
    finalizers:
      - kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog
  ```

You can also do it using the `oc` CLI:

```shell
oc get serviceinstance
oc edit serviceinstance <service_instance_id>

# Delete the following lines in metadata:
finalizers: null 	# add null
  - kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog   # Delete this line
```

> The OpenShift Catalog does not handle deploying templates globally (on all projects). If a template is deployed globally, OpenShift will try to create unnecessary objects such as provisioned service (aka. **ServiceInstance**), or ClusterClasses. Those services are not used, and some of them cannot be deleted easily. 
>
> At the moment it is much more reliable to create the template in each project.

You can also do it through the 

* Go to the **Provisionned Service** in the OpenShift UI overview

* Click on **Edit YAML**

* Remove the **finalizers**:

  ```yaml
    finalizers:
      - kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog
  ```

### Delete stuck project

Project can get stuck as marked for deletion. Usually due to ServiceInstance not terminated or a `finalizers` left in the **Project** YAML file.

This command remove `kubernetes-incubator` finalizers from ServiceInstance in terminating projects:

```shell
for i in $(oc get projects  | grep Terminating| awk '{print $1}'); do echo $i; oc get serviceinstance -n $i -o yaml | sed "/kubernetes-incubator/d"| oc apply -f - ; done
```
