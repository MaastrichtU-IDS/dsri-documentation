Connect to your project

```shell
oc project my-project
```

## Delete deployed service

The best way to delete all objects generated by a template deployment is to use the `oc` command with a selector.

The selector can easily be found in the template configuration:

<img src="/dsri-documentation/img/screenshot-get-deployment-label.png" alt="Get deployment label" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;" />

All object created by the template will be tagged with the labels defined at this step.

In this example, with Apache Spark, the following selector can be used: `--selector app=spark`

### Delete a deployment

Delete objects related to a deployment using a selector

```shell
oc delete all --selector app=my-deployment
```

### Delete all objects

Delete `all` does not include ConfigMaps and Secrets, to delete all objects related to a deployment use:

```shell
oc delete all --selector app=my-deployment
oc delete secret --selector app=my-deployment
oc delete configmaps --selector app=my-deployment
```

### Force deletion

```shell
oc delete all --force --grace-period=0 --selector app=my-deployment
```

## Delete pod

Get the ID of the specific pod you want to delete:

```shell
oc get pod
```

Use the pod ID retrieved to delete the pod:

```shell
oc delete pod <pod_id>
```

Force deletion:

```shell
oc delete pod --force --grace-period=0 <pod_id>
```

## Fix stuck deletions

### Stuck provisioned service

If a provisioned service is stuck on `Marked for deletion` you might need to set finalizers to null in the YAML.

This can be done using the OpenShift web UI:

* Go to the **Provisionned Service** in the OpenShift UI overview

* Click on **Edit YAML**

* Remove the **finalizers**:

  ```yaml
    finalizers:
      - kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog
  ```

You can also do it using the `oc` CLI:

```shell
oc get serviceinstance
oc edit serviceinstance <service_instance_id>

# Delete the following lines in metadata:
finalizers: null 	# add null
  - kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog   # Delete this line
```

> The OpenShift Catalog does not handle deploying templates globally (on all projects). If a template is deployed globally, OpenShift will try to create unnecessary objects such as provisioned service (aka. **ServiceInstance**), or ClusterClasses. Those services are not used, and some of them cannot be deleted easily. 
>
> At the moment it is much more reliable to create the template in each project.

You can also do it through the 

* Go to the **Provisionned Service** in the OpenShift UI overview

* Click on **Edit YAML**

* Remove the **finalizers**:

  ```yaml
    finalizers:
      - kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog
  ```

### Delete stuck project

Project can get stuck as marked for deletion. Usually due to ServiceInstance not terminated or a `finalizers` left in the **Project** YAML file.

This command remove `kubernetes-incubator` finalizers from ServiceInstance in terminating projects:

```shell
for i in $(oc get projects  | grep Terminating| awk '{print $1}'); do echo $i; oc get serviceinstance -n $i -o yaml | sed "/kubernetes-incubator/d"| oc apply -f - ; done
```
