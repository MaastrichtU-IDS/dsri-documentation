Feel free to propose new deployments using [pull requests](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/dsri-documentation/pulls) or request new ones by creating a [new issues](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/dsri-documentation/issues).


## Start JupyterLab with the root user

:::caution Root permission required

üîí You need root containers (aka. anyuid) enabled in your project to start this application.

:::

We will deploy the JupyterLab image with root user available at: [`ghcr.io/vemonet/jupyterlab`](https://github.com/users/vemonet/packages/container/package/jupyterlab)

This JupyterLab image comes with a Python 3.8 kernel with autocomplete and linting, a Java kernel and a SPARQL kernel.

Create the template in your project catalog if it is not present:

```bash
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/dsri-openshift-applications/main/templates-anyuid/template-jupyterlab-root-persistent.yml
```

You can deploy it using the **JupyterLab with root user (Persistent)** solutions in the [Catalog web UI](https://app.dsri.unimaas.nl:8443/console/catalog), the application will use an existing persistent storage to store your data.

<img src="/dsri-documentation/img/screenshot-deploy-jupyter.png" alt="Deploy Jupyter" style={{maxWidth: '100%', maxHeight: '100%'}} />

The following parameters can be provided:

1. Provide a unique **Application name**
2. The **Password** is safely stored in a Secret.
3. You can provide a **Git repository URL** with files to be downloaded and requirements to be installed at the start of the application. 
4. **Storage name** (only for persistent): the storage Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
5. **Storage folder** (only for persistent): path to the Notebook data folder in the Persistent Volume Claim storage, retrieve it in your project **Storage** page

:::tip Automatically install packages when the application starts

Pip requirements, apt packages and Jupyterlab extensions are installed from `requirements.txt`, `packages.txt` and `extensions.txt` requirement files. 

:::

Try the following Notebooks to work on a RDF Knowledge Graph about COVID-19 related publications: https://github.com/vemonet/covid-kg-notebooks

> The JupyterLab Docker image has been built from [amalic/Jupyterlab](https://github.com/amalic/Jupyterlab) image.

## Start JupyterLab with restricted user

Start JupyterLab images from the [official Jupyter docker stack](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks) with regular `jovyan` user, without `sudo` privileges.

Create the template in your project catalog:

```bash
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/dsri-openshift-applications/main/templates-restricted/template-jupyterlab-dynamic.yml
```

You can use any image based on the official Jupyter docker stack: https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks

* `jupyter/scipy-notebook`
* `jupyter/datascience-notebook` (with Julia kernel)
* `jupyter/tensorflow-notebook`
* `jupyter/r-notebook`
* `jupyter/pyspark-notebook`
* `jupyter/all-spark-notebook`
* `ghcr.io/maastrichtu-ids/jupyterlab-on-openshift` (with SPARQL and Java kernels)

Or build your own using this repository as example: https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/jupyterlab-on-openshift üì¶

:::warning Restricted user

**You will not be root user**‚ö†Ô∏è you will be able to install new `pip` packages, but you will not have `sudo` privileges (so no installation of `apt` or `yum` packages)

:::

:::info Persistent data folder

By default the working directory is `/home/jovyan`, the application will automatically create a persistent storage to store your data (find it in the **Storage** page of your project).

:::

## Use git in JupyterLab

You can use the [JupyterLab Git extension](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git) to clone and manage your `git` repositories.

It will prompt you for a username and password if the repository is private.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git/master/docs/figs/preview.gif" alt="JupyterLab Git extension" style={{maxWidth: '100%', maxHeight: '100%'}} />

You can also use `git` from the terminal.

:::caution Configure username

Before pushing back to GitHub or GitLab, you will need to **configure you username and email** in VSCode terminal:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Jean Dupont"
git config --global user.email jeandupont@gmail.com
```

:::

:::info Save your password

You can run this command to ask git to save your password for 15min:

```bash
git config credential.helper cache
```

Or store the password in a plain text file:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper 'store --file ~/.git-credentials'
```

:::tip Git tip

We recommend to use SSH instead of HTTPS connection when possible, checkout [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) how to generate SSH keys and use them with your GitHub account.

## Start JupyterHub

:::info For multiple users

This application is useful if you want to provide JupyterLab to multiple users.

:::

Use the **JupyterHub with GitHub authentication (Dynamic)** template to start a JupyterHub service, users will be able to login with their GitHub account, and start a notebook choosing from various images.

This solution enable you to use the DSRI to run Jupyter notebooks for multiple users without the need for a DSRI account, or knowledge of OpenShift. All they need is a GitHub account and access to the UM network (via the UM VPN).

:::tip Use different authentication systems

Checkout the [different authenticators implemented by JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/authenticators.html), and let us know if you would like to work together on implementing a new authentication system.

:::

Create the template in your project catalog:

```bash
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/dsri-openshift-applications/main/templates-restricted/template-jupyterhub-github-auth.yml
```

A custom image can be built and provided when deploying JupyterHub, see this repository as example to build a JupyterLab Docker image supported by OpenShift: https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/jupyterlab-on-openshift

You will need to register a new GitHub OAuth application for your JupyterHub instance to authenticate via GitHub:

1. Create a new OAuth app at https://github.com/settings/developers

2. Provide the following callback URL:
    * https://APPLICATION_NAME-OPENSHIFT_PROJECT.app.dsri.unimaas.nl/hub/oauth_callback
    * e.g. for the `ids-projects` project: https://jupyterhub-ids-projects.app.dsri.unimaas.nl/hub/oauth_callback

3. Add authorized GitHub users to the JupyterHub users when submitting the template to deploy JupyterHub in the OpenShift web UI. It can be changed from the **Admin** tab in the JupyterHub UI later.

:::info Dynamic storage

Persistent volumes are automatically created for each instance started in JupyterHub to insure persistence of the data even if the instances or JupyterHub are stopped.

:::

:::warning Restricted user

The users will be able to install new `pip` packages in their JupyterLab instance, but they will not have `sudo` privileges (so they cannot install `apt` or `yum` packages for example)
