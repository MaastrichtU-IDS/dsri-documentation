The DSRI is a good platform to run a training or class within Maastricht University.

## Request VPN accounts for users

If the users are **students** from Maastricht University, **or not** from Maastricht University (without an email @maastrichtuniversity.nl, or @maastro.nl), you will need to contact the ICT support of your department to request the creation of accounts so that your users can connect to the UM VPN.

At FSE, you will need to contact [lo-fse@maastrichtuniversity.nl](mailto:lo-fse@maastrichtuniversity.nl) 

You will need to provide the following informations:

* Name and emails of the users
* Why they need access to the DSRI (provide the ID of the course at Maastricht University if it is for a course)
* Until which date the users will need those VPN accounts

## Users fill a form

Send this quick form to the future users of the DSRI: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdndn0naNmj2ACpLE5j1S3Ngb1PCXK_Gl7oB-hI_mN4Z_NBQw/viewform

After they fill the form, and once we activated the DSRI account, each user will receive an email with more details .

## Prepare you workshop

Use the [DSRI documentation](/docs/access-dsri) to explain to your users how to access the DSRI.

### Publish an image for your training

Feel free to use the existing templates for JupyterLab, RStudio, or Visual Studio Code in the DSRI catalog.

You can easily reuse our images to adapt it to your training need and install all required dependencies:
* https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/jupyterlab
* https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/rstudio
* https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/code-server

Then you will just need to instruct your users to start an existing templates with your newly published image.

With the JupyterLab template you can also prepare a git repository to be cloned in the workspace as soon as they start it.

You can find some examples of python scripts with database to run on the DSRI in this repository: https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/dsri-demo


### Show your users how to start a workspace

You can use this video showing how to start a RStudio workspace, the process is similar for JupyterLab and VisualStudio Code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0BjotH1LiE

Otherwise just do it directly with them.
