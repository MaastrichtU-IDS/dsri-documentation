The Data Science Research Infrastructure is an [OKD](https://www.okd.io/) cluster (the open source version of [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/)), using the [MapR](https://mapr.com/) Distributed File System, and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) containers orchestration.

The DSRI provides a graphical user interface on top of the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) containers orchestration to easily deploy and manage services. 

:::warning New DSRI version available!

This documentation cover the legacy DSRI cluster using **OKD3.11** availabe at https://app.dsri.unimaas.nl:8443

A new cluster, much more friendly using **OKD4.6** is available at https://console-openshift-console.apps.dsri2.unimaas.nl

:::

## Which DSRI version should you use?

### New OKD 4.6 cluster

You need to start applications on CPU 

Storage of applications deployed in the new cluster is automated.

### Legacy OKD 3.11 cluster

You need to run applications on GPU (TensorFlow, PyTorch...)

Storage of applications deployed in the legacy cluster needs to be manually configured.

If you need to run applications on GPU, visit the [documentation for the legacy cluster](/docs/okd3-introduction).

## Getting started

### What can be done on the DSRI ‚úîÔ∏è

Run Data Science applications in [Docker container üê≥](https://www.docker.com/) on the [UM network](https://vpn.maastrichtuniversity.nl/), such as:

* Multiple flavors of [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks) (scipy, tensorflow, all-spark, and more)
* JupyterHub with GitHub authentication
* RStudio, with a complementary Shiny server
* VisualStudio [Code server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server)
* Tensorflow or PyTorch on Nvidia GPU (with JupyterLab or VisualStudio Code)
* Apache Flink cluster for streaming applications
* Or any program installed in a Docker image!

<!--

* SQL databases (MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
* NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Redis)
* Graph databases (GraphDB, Blazegraph, Virtuoso)
* Apache Spark for distributed computing
* Dask cluster for python distribution computing
-->

:::caution Data storage

**DSRI is a computing infrastructure**, built and used to run data science workloads. DSRI stores data in a persistent manner, but all data stored on the DSRI is susceptible to be altered by the workloads you are running, and we cannot guarantee its immutability.

**Always keep a safe copy of your data outside the DSRI**. And don't rely on the DSRI for long term storage.

:::

<!--

:::note Workflows

For user already familiar with those concepts [workflow orchestration tools](/dsri-documentation/docs/workflows-introduction) can be installed, such as [Argo workflows](/dsri-documentation/docs/workflows-argo), [Nextflow](/dsri-documentation/docs/workflows-nextflow) or [CWL Calrissian](/dsri-documentation/docs/workflows-cwl).

### What cannot be done ‚ùå

* Since DSRI can only be accessed when on the physical UM network or using the [UM VPN](https://vpn.maastrichtuniversity.nl/), deployed services will not be available on the public Internet üîí
* All activities must be legal in basis. You must closely examine and abide by the terms and conditions of any data, software, or web service that you use as part of your work üìú

:::info Request an account

If you are working at Maastricht University, **see [this page](https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/dsri-documentation/docs/access-dsri) to request an account**, and run your services on the DSRI.
