## Request access to internal UM servers

In certain cases, UM servers are not accessible by default from the DSRI. This is even the case for servers that are normally publicly accessible. To be able to access these UM servers from the DSRI, we need to put in the request to open the connection.

The procedure is described in the diagram below:
