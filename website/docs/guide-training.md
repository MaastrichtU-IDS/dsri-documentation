title: Use DSRI for training
---

The DSRI is a good platform to run a training or class within Maastricht University.

If the users are not from Maastricht University (with email at maastrichtuniversity.nl, student.maastrichtuniversity.nl, maastro.nl), you will need to contact the ICT support of your department to request the creation of accounts so that your users can connect to the UM VPN.

## Request users creation

Send this quick form to the future users of the DSRI: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdndn0naNmj2ACpLE5j1S3Ngb1PCXK_Gl7oB-hI_mN4Z_NBQw/viewform

Each user will get a DSRI account after they fill the form.


## Publish an image for your training

Feel free to use the existing templates for JupyterLab, RStudio, or Visual Studio Code in the DSRI catalog.

You can easily reuse our images to adapt it to your training need and install all required dependencies:
* https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/jupyterlab
* https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/rstudio
* https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/code-server

Then you will just need to instruct your users to start an existing templates with your newly published image.

With the JupyterLab template you can also prepare a git repository to be cloned in the workspace as soon as they start it.


## Show your users how to start a workspace

You can use this video showing how to start a RStudio workspace, the process is similar for JupyterLab and VisualStudio Code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0BjotH1LiE

Otherwise just do it directly with them.
