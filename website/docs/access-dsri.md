## Request an account

1. You will need to have an account at Maastricht University with an email ending with `@maastrichtuniversity.nl` or `@student.maastrichtuniversity.nl`.

2. Request access to the DSRI for your account  [to the DSRI support team ðŸ“¬](mailto:dsri-support-l@maastrichtuniversity.nl).


## Connect to the UM network

You need to be connected to the UM network to access the DSRI.

* Use the **Maastricht University VPN** at **[vpn.maastrichtuniversity.nl](https://vpn.maastrichtuniversity.nl/)**
* Connect to **UMnet** or **eduroam** WiFi at Maastricht University
* For **students**, use the Athena Student Desktop at [athenadesktop.maastrichtuniversity.nl](https://athenadesktop.maastrichtuniversity.nl)

* For **Linux**, use `openconnect` to connect to the UM VPN. You can easily install it on Ubuntu and Debian distributions with `apt`:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install openconnect
  sudo openconnect -u YOUR.USER --authgroup 01-Employees vpn.maastrichtuniversity.nl
  ```

  > Provide your UM password when prompted.

## Access the web UI

Access the DSRI web UI at **[https://console-openshift-console.apps.dsri2.unimaas.nl](https://console-openshift-console.apps.dsri2.unimaas.nl)**

:::info Password

Use your general UM password.

:::

If you do not have access to the DSRI [contact us](mailto:dsri-support-l@maastrichtuniversity.nl).

You will be able to login at **[https://console-openshift-console.apps.dsri2.unimaas.nl](https://console-openshift-console.apps.dsri2.unimaas.nl)** either using:

* The **prefix of your UM email address** with the first letter capitalized, e.g. `Firstname.Lastname` or `F.Lastname`
* Or your **employee number** at Maastricht University (a.k.a. P number), e.g. `P7000000`

:::info Command line interface

We recommend you to install the `oc` command line interface to perform additional operations on your applications, such as loading large amount of data using `oc cp`, or deploying an application from a local `Dockerfile`.

:::

## Access your project

In the DSRI OpenShift web UI, applications are deployed in projects.

1. Create a new project with a meaningful name describing what you are doing, such as "retail-behavior-analysis".

2. Go to your project (applications are deployed in a project).

:::caution Reuse your project

Only create new projects when it is necessary (for a new project). You can easily [clean up your current project](https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/dsri-documentation/docs/create-dsri-project#delete-a-project-using-the-web-ui) instead of creating a new one every time you want to try something.

## About the web UI

Developers can use the web console to **visualize**, **browse**, and **manage** the contents of projects in new version of OKD4. 

The [OpenShift Container Platform web console](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/web_console/odc-about-developer-perspective.html) provides two perspectives; 

* the **Administrator** perspective 
* the **Developer** perspective.

The Developer perspective provides workflows specific to developer use cases, such as the ability to:

* Create and deploy applications on OpenShift Container Platform by importing existing codebases, images, and dockerfiles.

* Visually interact with applications, components, and services associated with them within a project and monitor their deployment and build status.

* Group components within an application and connect the components within and across applications.

### Accessing the Developer perspective

You can access the **Developer** perspective from the web console as follows:

1. Log in to the OpenShift Container Platform web console using your login credentials. 

   * The default view for the OpenShift Container Platform web console is the **Administrator** perspective.

2. Use the perspective switcher to switch to the **Developer** perspective. The **Topology** view with a list of all the projects in your cluster is displayed.

   <img src="/dsri-documentation/img/screenshot_developer_perspective.png" alt="Developer Perspective" style={{maxWidth: '100%', maxHeight: '100%'}} />

3. Select an existing project from the list or use the **Project** drop-down list to create a new project.

:::info

If you have no workloads or applications in the project, the **Topology** view displays the available options to create applications. If you have existing workloads, the **Topology** view graphically displays your workload nodes.
