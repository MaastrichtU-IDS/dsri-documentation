:::info Command line interface

We recommend you to install the `oc` command line interface to perform additional operations on your applications, such as loading large amount of data using `oc cp`, or deploying an application from a local `Dockerfile`.

## Access your project

In the DSRI OpenShift web UI, applications are deployed in projects.

1. Create a new project with a meaningful name describing what you are doing, such as "retail-behavior-analysis".

2. Go to your project (applications are deployed in a project).

:::caution Reuse your project

Only create new projects when it is necessary (for a new project). You can easily clean up your current project instead of creating a new one every time you want to try something.
