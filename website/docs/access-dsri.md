:::info Password

Use your general UM password.

:::

If you do not have access to the DSRI [contact us](mailto:dsri-support-l@maastrichtuniversity.nl).

You will be able to login at **[https://console-openshift-console.apps.dsri2.unimaas.nl](https://console-openshift-console.apps.dsri2.unimaas.nl)** either using:

* The **prefix of your UM email address** with the first letter capitalized, e.g. `Firstname.Lastname` or `F.Lastname`

:::info Command line interface

We recommend you to install the `oc` command line interface to perform additional operations on your applications, such as loading large amount of data using `oc cp`, or deploying an application from a local `Dockerfile`.

:::

## Access your project

In the DSRI OpenShift web UI, applications are deployed in projects.

1. Create a new project with a meaningful name describing what you are doing, such as `workspace-yourname`.

2. Go to your project (applications are deployed in a project).

:::caution Reuse your project

Only create new projects when it is necessary (for a new project). You can easily [clean up your current project](https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/dsri-documentation/docs/project-management#delete-a-project-using-the-web-ui) instead of creating a new one every time you want to try something.

## About the web UI

Developers can use the web console to **visualize**, **browse**, and **manage** the contents of projects in new version of OKD4. 

The [OpenShift Container Platform web console](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/web_console/odc-about-developer-perspective.html) provides two perspectives; 

* the **Administrator** perspective 
* the **Developer** perspective.

The Developer perspective provides workflows specific to developer use cases, such as the ability to:

* Create and deploy applications on OpenShift Container Platform by importing existing codebases, images, and dockerfiles.

* Visually interact with applications, components, and services associated with them within a project and monitor their deployment and build status.

* Group components within an application and connect the components within and across applications.

### Accessing the Developer perspective

You can access the **Developer** perspective from the web console as follows:

1. Log in to the OpenShift Container Platform web console using your login credentials. 

   * The default view for the OpenShift Container Platform web console is the **Administrator** perspective.

2. Use the perspective switcher to switch to the **Developer** perspective. The **Topology** view with a list of all the projects in your cluster is displayed.

   <img src="/img/screenshot_developer_perspective.png" alt="Developer Perspective" style={{maxWidth: '100%', maxHeight: '100%'}} />

3. Select an existing project from the list or use the **Project** drop-down list to create a new project.

:::info

If you have no workloads or applications in the project, the **Topology** view displays the available options to create applications. If you have existing workloads, the **Topology** view graphically displays your workload nodes.
