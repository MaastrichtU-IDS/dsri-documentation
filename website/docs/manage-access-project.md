You can use the **Project** view in the **Developer** perspective to grant or revoke access permissions to your project.

To add users to your project and provide **Admin**, **Edit**, or **View** access to them:

1. In the **Developer** perspective, navigate to the **Project** view.

2. In the **Project** page, select the **Project Access** tab.

3. Click **Add Access** to add a new row of permissions to the default ones.

4. Enter the user name, click the **Select a role** drop-down list, and select an appropriate role.

5. Click **Save** to add the new permissions.

You can also use:

- The **Select a role** drop-down list, to modify the access permissions of an existing user.

- The **Remove Access** icon, to completely remove the access permissions of an existing user to the project.
