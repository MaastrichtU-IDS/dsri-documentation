## Machine Learning libraries

* See [this vulgarisation article](https://www.saagie.com/blog/machine-learning-for-grandmas/) explaining the different principles of Machine Learning.
* The [Azure Machine Learning Algorithm Cheat Sheet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/algorithm-cheat-sheet) helps you choose the right algorithm for a predictive analytics model.
* [This repository](https://github.com/TarrySingh/Artificial-Intelligence-Deep-Learning-Machine-Learning-Tutorials) provides tutorials and examples to a vast number of Machine / Deep Learning library.
